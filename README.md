I can't play actual Call of Duty so I'm making my own


It's based off the Call Of Duty games.
I'm new to game development and most the code is from tutorials.
If you have any suggestions or how to fix any bugs then you are welcome to tell me.
The name is also a placeholder so name might change during development.
Even though I'm a new game dev, and my code is a bit sloppy, I have just started this GitHub Repository as a backup and possibly to get help form other programmers who have more knowledge than me. I have little clue how GitHub works so this is just saying please do not steal my game. alot of other people probably have done the same thing as me but I have spent a lot of time on this project and do not want it to be stolen. if you would like to download the project and try to help me with my problems I am ok with that.

People I got tutorials from:
